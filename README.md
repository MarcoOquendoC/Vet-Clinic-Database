# Vet Clinic Database üè•
## Description:
In this project, I use a relational database to create the data structure for a vet clinic. 
  Here you can find the code to:
  - Section 1:
    - Create a table to store animals' information, 
    - Insert some data into it, and query it.
  - Section 2:
    - Use transactions to update and delete records. 
    - Use aggregate functions and GROUP BY to answer analytical questions.
  - Section 3:
    - Add some new tables.
    - Add foreign key columns to the existing animals' table to model one-to-many relationships. 
    - Use JOIN to query the data.
  - Section 4:
    - Add some many-to-many relationships.
    - Write more complex queries to use them to answer questions.

## Built With
- Relational Database PostgreSQL
- Visual Studio Code

## Getting Started

### Follow these steps in the "SQL Shell (psql)":
First create a database:
  > CREATE DATABASE vet_clinic;

The console should answer with "CREATE DATABASE" message.

Open the database created to start working on it:
> \c vet_clinic

The console should answer with "Now you are connected to the <<vet_clinic>> database with the user <<postgres>>" And it should change the beginning of the lines to "vet_clinic=#" line.

### This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
